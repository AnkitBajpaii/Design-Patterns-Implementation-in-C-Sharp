# Design-Patterns-in-C-Sharp

Software design principles are a set of guidelines that helps developers to make a good system design. The most important principle is SOLID principles and interactions of objects. And Design patterns provide solutions to common problems which occur in software design.  
Design patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.

Types of Design Patterns:
These can be organized in 4 separate pattern groups depending on the nature of the design problem they intend to solve.

- Gang of Four Patterns
- Enterprise Patterns
- SOA and Messaging Patterns
- Model-View Patterns

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns. They are categorized in three groups:  
- Creational
- Structural  
- Behavioral
